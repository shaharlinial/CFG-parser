# context-free grammar parser
This is a context-free grammar parser that uses the CKY algorithm, implemented in Python. This parser is capable of parsing sentences using the rules and productions of a context-free grammar. 
The CKY algorithm allows for efficient parsing of a wide range of context-free grammars, making this parser suitable for use in natural language processing applications. The parser is implemented in a class, which has a "train" method that allows the parser to be trained on a treebank training set file. It also has a "write_parse" method, which can be used to parse a list of sentences and write the resulting parses to an output file in the same format as the input treebank.

This parser can be used to improve the accuracy of natural language processing applications that rely on context-free grammar parsing.
